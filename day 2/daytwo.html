    <h1>HI THIS IS  AVINASH DEHARIYA DAY 2 ASSIGNMENT</h1>
    <P>THIS IS A PARAGRAPH ABOUT ME THING OF NATURE</P>
    <PRE>
        am always thankful to my family and my friends for making me so humble and helping me every day trying to show me the
        goal amongst the bunch of cloudy weather. Life is a jar of both happiness as well as sadness. Getting always what we
        want, is not the nature of life.
    </PRE>
